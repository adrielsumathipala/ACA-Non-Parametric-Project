#Non-Parametric and Parametric Analysis of the Affordable Care Act

##Overview:

In this report, I used the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) insurance premiums data to perform a range of non-parametric and parametric statistical analysis, characterizing the relative difference between parametric and non-parametric methods. In the spring of 2018, I took "Non-Parametric Statistics and Machine Learning" (S&DS 468) a theoretical, upper-level statistics course with John Lafferty. For the course's final project I completed this analysis, producing the 52-page report that can be viewed in this repository (see `FINAL_468_Project.pdf`).

##Contents:

This repository contains:

* **PDF Report**—This report contains the code I used to perform the non-parametric and parametric analysis, data plots, regression models, and remarks regarding findings in the data and characterization of non-parametric and parametric analysis in the context of this dataset.

* **R Markdown Source Code**—This file contains the code used to create the compiled .pdf report

* **Data Files**—These files contain the data used in this analysis. This data was obtained from HealthData.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
